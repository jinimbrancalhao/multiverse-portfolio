## Tic-Tac-Toe

This application was a ton of fun to build! The CSS is not yet complete but most of the functionality is. One of the first projects I built when I began coding was Tic-Tac-Toe. I was excited to begin working on this to see how much more I could add to it.

This Tic-Tac-Toe has two game modes:
- 1 player (easy or hard mode)
- 2 player

My favorite part of the app was building the 1 player functionality. When playing the easy mode, the CPU makes it's choices randomly making it an easier opponent. When playing the hard mode, the CPU will make it's choices based off the winning combinations making it a tougher opponent.
