## Impossible-Memory-Game

This is a React.js application, collaboratively built for a hackathon. The idea of the game is the cards will momentarily show their faces before flipping over. The challenge is to remember all the matches and select them after the cards flip over.

This was a very fun project to practice creating game logic, as well as CSS practice as we had to create dynamic elements on the page.
