## Dog Adoption Frontend

This was a collaborative project which had two main focuses. First we wanted to create a React frontend with well built out functionality, as well as a high level of CSS. We also wanted to learn and implement CI / CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) workflow.

We were able to achieve CI / CD utilizing Github Pages and SonarCloud which provided code quality insights.
