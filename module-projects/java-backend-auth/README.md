## Java Backend with Auth

This backend application was built as part of our backend module.

This application allows for full CRUD functionality for Users and Products. Each request must be sent with the proper token as well as user credentials. There is also authorization functionality, where certain endpoints are only accessible to users with the ADMIN role.

It was a great experience to practice backend development and build authentication and authorization functionality. This was the first time I had built an app with both!
