# Multiverse Final Portfolio

## Overview

Over this past year or so with Multiverse and Commure, I have learned and implemented an array of different technologies. From starting the bootcamp learning Vanilla JavaScript, to now having worked on two enterprise applications with Commure, it's been a great year!

This repository is a collection of the work and learning that I've done throughout my time here at Multiverse / Commure.

In this section is a few of the projects I have worked on, individually and collaboratively, throughout the modules during the apprenticeship. There is also a README that will provide further information about the projects!

## [Personal Projects](https://github.com/jinimbrancalhao/multiverse-portfolio/tree/main/personal-projects)

In this section is a few projects I have worked on outside of Commure and Multiverse. These projects were typically centered around furthering my skillset by learning a new technology, or reinforcing my knowledge of a technology.

## [Professional Projects](https://github.com/jinimbrancalhao/multiverse-portfolio/tree/main/professional-projects)

In this section, I will discuss my experience as a developer at Commure, describing my responsibilities and accomplishments. Due to the sensitive nature of the Commure codebase, I will not share any code snippets.

## Thank You!

My time here with Multiverse has been incredible, and I will always be grateful for this experience. I couldn't have asked for a better way to kickstart my career in development.

Thank you Commure for trusting me with this amazing opportunity. I have learned and grown so much as a developer.

Thank you to my Multiverse coach Brad DeFauw for all your help throughout the apprenticeship. It wouldn't have been the same without your positive energy and kindness!
