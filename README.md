<h1>Multiverse Final Portfolio</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Over this past year or so with Multiverse and Commure, I have learned and implemented an array of different technologies. From starting the bootcamp learning vanilla JavaScript, to now having worked on two enterprise applications with Commure, it's been a great year!

This repository is a collection of the work and learning that I've done throughout my time here at Multiverse / Commure.</p>

<h3>Module Projects</h3>

<p>In this section is a few of the projects I have worked on, individually and collaboratively, throughout the modules during the apprenticeship. There is also a README that will provide further information about the projects!</p>

<h3>Personal Projects</h3>

<p>In this section is a few projects I have worked on outside of Commure and Multiverse. These projects were typically centered around furthering my skillset by learning a new technology, or reinforcing my knowledge of a technology.</p>

<h3>Professional Projects</h3>

<p>In this section, I will discuss my experience as a developer at Commure, describing my responsibilities and accomplishments. Due to the sensitive nature of the Commure codebase, I will not share any code snippets.</p>

<h3>Thank You!</h3>

<p>My time here with Multiverse has been incredible, and I will always be grateful for this experience. I couldn't have asked for a better way to kickstart my career in development.</p>

<p>Thank you Commure for trusting me with this amazing opportunity. I have learned and grown so much as a developer.</p>

<p>Thank you to my Multiverse coach Brad DeFauw for all your help throughout the apprenticeship. It wouldn't have been the same without your positive energy and kindness!</p>
