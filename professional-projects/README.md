# Professional Projects

In my time here at Commure I've been able to work on two applications, PatientKeeper and CommureOS. The majority of my year has been focused on PatientKeeper, and I've more recently switched over to working on CommureOS.

### PatientKeeper:

While working on the PatientKeeper application, I was part of an agile team focused on backend development (JF 1.4 | JF 1.5 | JF 1.7). I was able to complete over 20 stories while working on this application. The stories varied from bug fixes to new feature development. The main technologies utilized on PatientKeeper were Java, JUnit, Spring Framework, and JavaScript.

One of the first stories assigned to me was to build two Rest API endpoints (JF 3.2 | JF 3.5 | JF 3.6 | JF 4.6 | JF 4.8). This task always sticks out to me as such a growing experience. I didn't know any of the technologies at this point, and I had never worked on an enterprise level application. It was a great challenge, and from this, I learned so much as well as gained a ton of confidence. These endpoints were created using the DTO (Data Transfer Object) design pattern and dependency injection to maintain loose coupling, abstraction, and maintainability.

In the summer of 2022, I worked on an epic containing six stories. Of these six stories I worked on and completed three. I demoed the features I worked on to the PM, which was a great experience. In this epic I was able to make a significant impact, which I look back on as a great accomplishment (JF 6.7)!

Nearing the end of 2022 and my time working on PatientKeeper, I worked on a rule system utilizing the Drools Rule Management System. As part of a new epic to build a very complex rule, my task was to build an initial version of the rule (JF 6.4 | JF 6.6). Ultimately, I was moved to work on CommureOS before this epic was completed, but I was able to build this initial version of the rule. It was a great opportunity to drive a new epic, and I really enjoyed this opportunity to learn something new.

### CommureOS:

The technologies we use on CommureOS are mainly JavaScript, Go, Rust, and React-Native. 

I am currently working on building the mobile app for CommureOS. I have an amazing opportunity to help build this app from the ground up. As most of my professional experience has been working on the backend with Java, mobile development is very new for me. It's been a great experience so far, and I'm excited to continue learn (JF 2.3 | JF 2.5)!
